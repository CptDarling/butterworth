    <h2>My Dearest Miss Olivia,</h2>
  </header>
  <p>
    I hope this missive finds you in good spirits. Allow me to introduce myself, for we have not had the pleasure of a
    proper introduction. I am Butterworth, the eerie waiter who has been haunting your Halloween festivities. I
    understand
    that my presence has struck fear into your tender heart, and for this, I am truly sorry.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please know that my intentions are far from malevolent, dear Olivia. I am but a humble specter, a creation of the
    season's merriment, designed to delight and entertain those who venture into our mysterious world. The shivers that
    I
    send down your spine are not meant to cause you harm but rather to stir the enchanting atmosphere of this hallowed
    night.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand that it can be overwhelming to be confronted by the unknown, especially for a young soul like yourself.
    My
    eerie appearance, the darkness that surrounds me, and the creaking of my bones may seem unsettling, but I assure
    you,
    they are all mere illusions. I am here to serve, not to frighten.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you would permit me, I would be honored to extend an invitation to you, Miss Olivia. Join me in the realm of the
    supernatural, where the mundane world and the enchanting one intermingle. In this spectral haven, you shall find
    treats
    beyond your wildest dreams, and no tricks that would cause you harm. It is a place of pure, eerie delight.
  </p>
  <p>
    Should you muster the courage to accept my invitation, you will find that the haunted waiters, like myself, are not
    to
    be feared. Rather, we are here to make your Halloween night unforgettable, a memory to be cherished for years to
    come.
  </p>
  <p>
    I understand that my presence may be daunting, but I promise you, Miss Olivia, there is no harm that will befall you
    in
    my company. The spirits of this Halloween night mean only to share in the magic of the season and bring a smile to
    your
    face.
